<h1>MATH3161 Exam Generator</h1>

Please note that the code in this repository is not polished, nor do I actually want feedback on how poorly I did. I wanted each document to work individually without dependency on other files (for reasons), and I can't guarantee that the exams shown on this are even correct. I haven't even properly studied all the topics in this test by the time of uploading this version, so please don't have high hopes this was just a proof of concept.

The program generates a `tex` file, so you'll need to render it yourself. Also, I recommend running this code until no errors or warnings are printed. Usually takes around five to ten attempts but might take more. This is because of the induction question and I cannot be bothered fixing it.
