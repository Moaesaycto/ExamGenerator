<h1>MATH3161 Exam Generator</h1>

This project contains a simple examination generator for mathematical optimisation problems that I studied in university. I found that a lot of the course work I was doing was quite repetitive, so I decided to stick it to the man and make a program that generates problems for me. I did this to both learn how to actually solve these problems while also wanting to make a point about how a lot of undergrad mathematics courses are just repetitive and don't require any creativity.

The program generates a `tex` file, so you'll need to render it yourself. Also, I recommend running this code until no errors or warnings are printed. Usually takes around five to ten attempts but might take more. This is because of the induction question and I cannot be bothered fixing it.

Please note that the code in this repository is not polished. I can't guarantee that the exams shown on this are fully correct and work every time. I haven't even properly studied all the topics in this test by the time of uploading this, so please don't have high hopes this was just a proof of concept.
